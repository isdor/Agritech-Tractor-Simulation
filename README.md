# Agritech-Tractor-Simulation
Simulates agricultural tractor movement using Python and Pygame. This project creates a digital twin of farm operations, demonstrating efficient ploughing patterns with loops and functions for modular, intelligent decision-making in autonomous farming. Features grid-based fields and realistic tractor turns.
